This repository contains my code, related data, and results. It does not contain my report.

This entire exercise is meant to be run from Jupyter notebook on Google Colab! I have added files here per the requirements with the prompts, generated code, test cases, and evaluated results, however these are not referenced or output by the script; the script contains everything it needs to run without any dependencies.

The dataset used in this project is the HumanEval+ dataset from https://huggingface.co/datasets/evalplus/humanevalplus.
